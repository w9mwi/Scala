Scala Vectors are very similar to Scala Lists.  If you only need to process the head
of a List, then use a List.  But if you need to access elements within the List,
as well as process the List's head, use a Vector.  As accessing elements within
a Vector is much more efficient than accessing elements in a List.

A Scala Vector is immutable, whereas a Scala List can be mutable or immutable.
