When a function is called via Pass-By-Value, the function gets a copy of
the variable passed to it, but the function cannot change the variable
that exists in the calling code.

When a function is called via Pass-By-Reference, the function called
can change the value of the param that it gets passed, so its value
in the code that calls the function gets changed.  In other words,
the function can change a value contained in the calling code.  Scala
does NOT have this Pass-By-Reference capability.  Scala allows ONLY
Pass-By-Name and Pass-By-Value.

Pass-By-Value - This is the standard (very common) way a parameter
                is passed to a function.  The following code snips
                are examples of Pass-By-Value:

                val name:String = "Joe Blow"
                val ssn:String = "123-45-6789"

                deleteRecord(name, ssn)
                deleteRecord("Jane Sixpack", "987-65-4321")

                You can also pass a function to another function.  When
                you pass a function to another function, you can pass
                the function as a parameter "by name" or "by value."

                When you pass a function to another function "by value",
                you are passing that function A BLOCK OF SCALA CODE, instead
                of the name of a function that has been defined.  See
                the code examples below for examples of Pass-By-Value
                functions.  Another name for a Pass-By-Value function
                is a "Nullary Function".

Pass-By-Name - In Pass-By-Name, an argument/parameter is NOT passed by value,
               but is passed as the name of a Scala function that has been
               defined via the Scala 'def' keyword.

               Pass-By-Name isn't a very accurate description.  Better names
               for Pass-By-Name (which aren't really used) could be:
                  * Call-On-Access
                  * Evaluate-On-Access
                  * Evaluate-On-Use
                  * Evaluate-When-Accessed
                  * Evaluate-When-Referenced

Below are some sample programs which demonstrate Scala's Pass-By-Name
and Pass-By-Value feature.  Read in-line comments for explanations.

    // EXAMPLE 1) Here we call the timer() function (defined below) by first assigning

The Array.fill and List.fill functions are CURRIED FUNCTIONS that takes two argument lists.
The first argument list is an Int value specifying the number of elements in the Array/List.
The second argument is a PASS-BY-NAME argument specifying the value of each Array/List element.

WARNING: The following code is only an example that shows how the Array/List fill() function
         behaves.  It's unlikely you'd ever want to write code similar to this, cuz it's
         way too convoluted/confusing.

object Demo
{
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
  {
    var arrayInts:Array[Int] = Array.fill(10)(5)
    for (x <- arrayInts) { print(x + " ") } // PRINTS: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    println()

    var listInts:List[Int] = List.fill(5)(10)
    for (x <- listInts) { print(x + " ") } // PRINTS: 10 10 10 10 10
    println()

    var listStrings:List[String] = List.fill(5)("TJB")
    for (x <- listStrings) { print(x + " ") } // PRINTS: TJB TJB TJB TJB TJB
    println()

    // Since the second argument list of Array.fill is PASSED BY NAME,
    // it is evaluated for each element, as demonstrated in the
    // following call to Array.fill, which prints this:
    // Evaluating arg.
    // Evaluating arg.
    arrayInts = Array.fill(2){ println("Evaluating arg."); 5 } // NOTE: Adding () around the {} is optional.
    // The following for() loop prints: 5 5
    for (x <- arrayInts) { print(x + " ") }
    println()

    var number:Int = 1
    // Since the second argument list of List.fill is PASSED BY NAME,
    // it is evaluated for each element, as demonstrated in the
    // following call to List.fill, which prints this: 1 2 4
    listInts = List.fill(3){ print(number + " "); number *= 2; number } // NOTE: Adding () around the {} is optional.
    println()
    // The following for() loop prints: 2 4 8
    for (x <- listInts) { print(x + " ") }
  }
}

=========================================================================

The following code sample is just another example of CURRIED FUNCTIONS
implemented by Arrays and Lists.  In other words, the fill() and tabulate()
function shown below are CURRIED FUNCTIONS.  Read the code sample immediately
above for more details about how these CURRIED FUNCTIONS work.

object Demo
{
  def main(args: Array[String])
  {
    var intArray:Array[Int] = Array.fill(10)(4)
    intArray.foreach(println)  // Prints the number 4 a total of 10 times.

    var stringList:List[String] = List.fill(6)("XYZ")
    stringList.foreach(println)  // Prints the string "XYZ" a total of 6 times.

    var idx:Int = 1
    var intList:List[Int] = List.fill(5){(idx*=2); idx} // NOTE: The second argument is in curly braces.
    intList.foreach(println)  // Prints these 5 elements of intList:  2, 4, 8, 16, 32
    intList = 1::intList      // Prepend a 1 onto intList.
    intList.foreach(println)  // Prints these 6 elements of intList:  1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
    intList = List.tabulate(10)(i => i*i)
    intList.foreach(println)  // Prints these 10 elements of intList: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81

    // Create a new 6-element Array, where each element in the Array is initialized with
    // the value: (3*x*x + 5x - 7)   Where the value x is the index of the Array.
    // NOTE: All Arrays and Lists begin with an index value of zero (0).
    intArray = Array.tabulate(6)(x => 3*x*x + 5*x - 7) // NOTE: Uses (), equivalent to the line below.
    intArray = Array.tabulate(6){x => 3*x*x + 5*x - 7} // NOTE: Uses {}, equivalent to the line above.
    intArray.foreach(println) // Prints these 6 elements of intArray: -7, 1, 15, 35, 61, 93

    // NOTE: The last value printed below will ALWAYS be ONE LESS than the maximum value in
    //       the range.  So in this instance, the last value printed is eleven (11)...
    intArray = Array.range(0, 12)
    intArray.foreach(print) // PRINTS: 01234567891011
    println
    intList  = List.range(0, 12)
    intList.foreach(print)  // PRINTS: 01234567891011
  }
}
