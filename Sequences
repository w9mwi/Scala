Sequence is a trait.  If you look at the following println statement, you'll
see the elements of the Sequence were rendered into an Immutable List.

val seq: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Chocolate Donut")
println(s"seq = $seq") // PRINTS: seq = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Chocolate Donut)

The following two lines of Scala code are equivalent, as
a List of Int values is identical to a Seq of Int values.

val a = Seq(1,2,3)
val a:Seq[Int] = List(1,2,3)
