A Scala trait can define itself as a "self type".  When a Scala trait defines
itself as a "self type", it means it can be inherited ONLY by the class name
designated in the self type declaration.

When a Scala trait is defined as a self type, the following 3) criteria are met.
See the code snip below for reference.

1) The first line of code inside the trait must be the self type declaration.
2) The self type declaration always begins with "this:" followed by the class name.
   "this" is a Scala keyword that references the trait (or class) in which it appears.
   (In the following example, "this" references the EngineSound class.


   abstract class Engine extends EngineSound

   trait EngineSound
   {
     this: Engine => // The self type declaration.  Must always be the first line.
   }

    //       designates a Scala "self-type".  In this example, the
    //       "this" keyword designates the trait DogTailServices.
    //       So the following line of code designates that the trait
    //       DogTailServices can be inherited ONLY by the
    //       AnimalWithTail class.
    this: AnimalWithTail =>  // When a self-type declaration is used, it MUST be

    //       So the following line of code designates that the trait

    // Unlike the 2 commented-out lines above, the following 2 lines of code

    object myAnimal_3 extends AnimalWithTail_2
    myAnimal_3.function // PRINTS: AnimalWithTail_2.function called.

    // The following 2 lines DO COMPILE because the DogMouthServices and DogTailServices
    // traits are defined to be inherited by the AnimalWithTail class.
