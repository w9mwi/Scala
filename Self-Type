A Scala trait can define itself as a "self type".  When a Scala trait defines
itself as a "self type", it means it can be inherited ONLY by the class/trait/object
name designated in the self type declaration.

When a Scala trait is defined as a self type, the following 3) criteria are met.

1) The first line of code inside the trait must be the self type declaration.
2) The self type declaration USUALLY begins with the text "this:" or "self:",
   followed by the trait/class name, a space char., ending with the rocket symbol "=>".
   NOTE: A self type declaration DOESN'T need to begin with "this:" or "self:".
         It can begin with any text you want followed by the colon (:) character,
         such as "blue:", "wet:", "joe:", etc.  However, it's recommended that
         you always use "this:" or "self:"
3) The class referenced in the self type declaration specifies the ONLY class
   that can inherit from the trait.

QUESTION: What's the fundamental difference between inheritance and a self type?
ANSWER:   The following code sample and comments describe the difference.

          trait Animal
          trait Dog extends Animal // This is INHERITANCE, which means a Dog IS an Animal.

          trait Person
          trait Diet {
            this:Person => // This is a SELF TYPE, which means a Diet REQUIRES a Person.
                           // In other words, ONLY a Person can inherit from Diet.
          }

          // The following 3 lines WILL COMPILE, even though they may not make logical sense.
          trait  JetAircraft extends Dog
          class  Automobile  extends Dog
          object Hamburger   extends Dog

          // The following 2 lines WILL COMPILE because both Boy and Girl inherit from Person.
          // (Diet requires that Boy and Girl must be a Person.)
          trait Boy  extends Person with Diet
          trait Girl extends Diet   with Person

          // The following line WON'T COMPILE because Cat doesn't inherit from Person.
          // (Diet requires that Cat must be a Person.)
          trait Cat extends Diet

The following code sample uses traits that have self-type declarations.
Read in-line comments for details.

import java.awt.Color

  trait Animal
  abstract class AnimalWithTail(tailColor:Color) extends Animal
  {
    def getTailColor:Color = tailColor

  }

  trait DogTailServices
  {
    // NOTE: The following line of code (this: AnimalWithTail =>)
    //       designates a Scala "self-type".  In this example, the
    //       "this" keyword designates the trait DogTailServices.
    //       So the following line of code designates that the trait
    //       DogTailServices can be inherited ONLY by the
    //       AnimalWithTail class.
    this: AnimalWithTail =>  // When a self-type declaration is used, it MUST be
                             // THE FIRST LINE OF CODE inside a trait declaration.

    def curlTail:Unit  = println("Curling Tail!")
    def lowerTail:Unit = println("Lowering Tail!")
    def raiseTail:Unit = println("Raising Tail!")
    def wagTail:Unit   = println("Wagging Tail!")

  trait DogMouthServices
  {
    // NOTE: The following line of code (this: AnimalWithTail =>)
    //       designates a Scala "self-type".  In this example, the
    //       "this" keyword designates the trait DogMouthServices.
    //       So the following line of code designates that the trait
    //       DogMouthServices can be inherited ONLY by the
    //       AnimalWithTail class.
    this: AnimalWithTail =>  // When a self-type declaration is used, it MUST be
                             // THE FIRST LINE OF CODE inside a trait declaration.

    def bark:Unit = println("Bow-Wow!")
    def lick:Unit = println("Lick Me!")
  }

  /********************************************
   * main() function
   ********************************************/
  def main(args: Array[String])
  {
    println("main() is executed.")

    // Since the object IrishSetter extends the AnimalWithTail class,
    // IrishSetter can call the methods contained in the DogTailServices
    // and DogMouthServices traits.
    object IrishSetter extends AnimalWithTail(Color.RED) with DogTailServices with DogMouthServices
    IrishSetter.bark                  // PRINTS: Bow-Wow!
    IrishSetter.lick                  // PRINTS: Lick Me!
    IrishSetter.curlTail              // PRINTS: Curling Tail!

    println(IrishSetter.getTailColor) // PRINTS: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]

    // If you uncomment the following 2 commented-out lines THEY WON'T COMPILE
    // because the DogMouthServices and DogTailServices traits are defined to
    // be used ONLY when the AnimalWithTail class inherits them.
    // object myAnimal_1 extends AnimalWithTail_2 with DogMouthServices
    // object myAnimal_2 extends AnimalWithTail_2 with DogTailServices

    // Unlike the 2 commented-out lines above, the following 2 lines of code
    // will compile and execute successfully because AnimalWithTail_2 DOESN'T
    // inherit from the DogMouthServices or DogTailServices traits.
    object myAnimal_3 extends AnimalWithTail_2
    myAnimal_3.function // PRINTS: AnimalWithTail_2.function called.

    // The following 2 lines DO COMPILE because the DogMouthServices and DogTailServices
    // traits are defined to be inherited by the AnimalWithTail class.
    object myAnimal_4 extends AnimalWithTail(Color.YELLOW) with DogMouthServices
    object myAnimal_5 extends AnimalWithTail(Color.BLUE)   with DogTailServices
  }
}
