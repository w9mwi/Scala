Currying - If you have a function that takes multiple arguments,
           you can translate that function into series of function
           calls that each take a single argument.  Here is an
           example.  Assume we have these 3 functions:
           f(x) = x + 10
           f(y) = y - 3
           f(z) = z * 4
           
           From the above 3 functions, we can create this expression:
           f(x)(y)(z)
           
           The above expresion reads like this:
           1) Call function f(z),
           2) which returns function f(y),
           3) which calls function f(x),
           4) which returns a result.

           In pseudo code the above expression can be written like this:
           func1 = f(z)
           func2 = func1(y)
           result = func2(z)



           func(x)       = x + 10
           func(x)(y)    = func((x + 10) - 3)
           func(x)(y)(z) = func(((x + 10) - 3)) * 4)

           result = func(x)(y)(z)
