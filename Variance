Variance in Scala defines Inheritance relationships of Parameterized Types.
Variance is all about Sub-Typing, aka Inheritance.

List[T] - List[T] in known as a Generic.  T is known as a "Type Parameter."  When
          List[T] is used as a List[Int], or List[Float], or List[String], or
          List[Boolean], etc. those are known as "Parameterized Types."
          
Variance - Defines Inheritance relationship between Parameterized Types, such as
           the relationship between List[Int] and List[AnyVal], because List[Int]
           INHERITS FROM List[AnyVal].

Scala supports the following THREE (3) kinds of Variance.

1) Covariant
2) Invariant
3) Contravariant
