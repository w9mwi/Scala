Variance in Scala defines Inheritance relationships of Parameterized Types.
Variance is all about Sub-Typing, aka Inheritance.

List[T] - List[T] in known as a Generic.  T is known as a "Type Parameter."

Parameterized Types - When List[T] is used as a List[Int], or List[Float], or List[String],
                      or List[Boolean], etc. those are known as "Parameterized Types."
          
Variance - Defines Inheritance relationship between Parameterized Types, such as
           the relationship between List[Int] and List[AnyVal], as List[Int]
           INHERITS FROM List[AnyVal].

Scala supports the following THREE (3) kinds of Variance, which are discussed below.
1) Covariant Variance
2) Invariant Variance
3) Contravariant Variance

Covariant Variance
==================
Covariant Variance is a kind of INHERITANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TO PARAMATIZED TYPES.
For example, if type S is a subtype of type T, then List[S] is is a subtype of List[T].
This kind of Inheritance Relationship between two Parameterized Types is known as Covariant.

To represent a Covariance relationship between two Parameterized Types, Scala prefixes a
Type Parameter with the '+' character.  This '+' character is known as Variance Annotation,
or in this example, Covariance Annotation.
FOR EXAMPLE:  List[+T]
If you look at the Scala API for List, you'll see List is defined using the
'+' (Covariance Annotation) character, like this:
sealed abstract class List[+A] extends ...
SEE --> https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html

In the code example shown further below we have this...
class Animal[+T](val animal:T)
class Dog
class Puppy extends Dog
class AnimalCarer(val dog:Animal[Dog])

Notice that AnimalCarer() above is defined so it must be instantiated with an Animal[Dog] class.
So if you 


Now we'll create our own generic class named Animal, which will allow Animal Parameterized Types
(i.e., Animal[Puppy], Animal[Dog]) to inherit from it.

Since Puppy is a subtype of Dog, Animal[Puppy] is a subtype of Animal[Dog].
