Below are some examples of how to use standard Scala classes (not case classes).

========================================================================
The syntax used for defining getter and setter methods for regular Scala
classes is rather strange.  The following code demonstrates how to use
getter and setter methods for standard Scala classes.  Read the comments
for details.  For more info on Scala classes see:
http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/classes.html

object Demo
{
  class Point
  {
    private var _x = 0
    private var _y = 0
    private val bound = 100

    def x = { _x } // This is a getter method.
    // The method below is a setter method.  There must be no whitespace before or after the _ character for x_=
    def x_= (newValue: Int): Unit =
    {
      if (newValue < bound) _x = newValue
      else printWarning
    }

    def y = { _y } // This is a getter method.
    // The method below is a setter method.  There must be no whitespace before or after the _ character for y_=
    def y_= (newValue: Int): Unit =
    {
      if (newValue < bound) _y = newValue
      else printWarning
    }

    private def printWarning = println("WARNING: Out of bounds!")
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]) =
  {
    val point1 = new Point

    // The following 2 lines call the above setter methods x_= and y_=
    point1.x = 99  // This line calls the x_= setter method.
    point1.y = 101 // This line calls the y_= setter method.

    // The following 2 lines call the above getter methods x and y
    println("point1.x = " + point1.x) // This line calls the x getter method.
    println("point1.y = " + point1.y) // This line calls the y getter method.
  }
}
