MONAD - When speaking casually, some people say that any
        Scala class that implements both the map() and
        flatMap() methods is a MONAD.  That is NOT totally
        accurate, but it is close to being true.  Some
        Scala guy once said...

        "The only thing monads are relevant for, from a
        Scala language perspective, is their ability of
        being used in a for-comprehension."

        In Scala there is no base Monad trait to extend.
        All you have to do is implement map() and flatMap()
        so your class can be used as a generator in for
        expressions.  The List and Option Scala classes
        are true monads!!!

FUNCTOR - At some point in history, someone declared that
          "things that can be mapped-over shall be called
          functors."  Therefore, classes like List, Option,
          Future (and many others) are all functors.  Again...
          "Functors are things that can be mapped over."
          
          Functor = map-able = A class that contains a map() method.
