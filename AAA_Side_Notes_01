Every object in Scala is an instance the Any object, which is the top object
in the object tree.  So every other object in Scala is a child of the Any object.
At the bottom of the object tree is the Nothing object, which is a subtype
(a child) of ALL Scala objects.  The Nothing object exists to handle situations
where functions never return.

Scala provides 3 constructs for creating user-defined types:
1) classes
2) traits
3) objects - Singleton objects, meaning "static" (only one instance) objects.
