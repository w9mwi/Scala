Every object in Scala is an instance the Any object, which is the top object
in the object tree.  So every other object in Scala is a child of the Any object.
At the bottom of the object tree is the Nothing object, which is a subtype
(a child) of ALL Scala objects.  The Nothing object exists to handle situations
where functions never return.

Scala provides 3 constructs for creating user-defined types:
1) classes
2) traits
3) objects - Singleton objects, meaning "static" (only one instance) objects.

==================================================================

Every object in Scala is an instance of the "Any" object, because the
"Any" object is the parent of ALL other objects.  The Any object is
the direct parent of these two objects: AnyVal and AnyRef

The "Nothing" object (which has no value) is a subtype of ALL Scala
objects, and it exists to handle situations when functions don't
return a value.
