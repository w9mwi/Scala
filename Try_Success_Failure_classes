This page describes how to use the Scala types
"Either" and "Try".  NOTE: The "Try" type is not
that same as the "try" Scala keyword that's used
with "catch".

The Option/Some/None classes are similar to the
Try/Failure/Success classes...
SEE ALSO --> https://github.com/w9mwi/Scala/blob/master/Option_Some_None_Classes

Just like the "Option" type will always have a subclass
"Some " or "None", the "Either" type will always have
a subclass of "Success" or "Failure".  Where "Failure"
contains the reason why something failed.
