Combinator - The idea of being able to combine, or chain,
             functions together like a UNIX command
             pipeline:   ps aux grep root wc -l

Functor - Things that can be mapped over.  For example,
          an Array and a List both contain elements.
          For each of those elements a function can be
          called that returns a value.  So you could
          call a function named add() on every element
          of the Array, or the List.



Higher-Order Function - A function that can be passed other functions
                        as parameters, and/or returns a function.

Lambda - Another word for an anonymous function.
