Combinator - The idea of being able to combine, or chain, functions
             together like a UNIX command pipeline:
             $ ps aux grep root wc -l


Functor - Things that can be mapped over.  For example, an Array and a List
          both contain elements.  For each of those elements a function can
          be called that returns a value.  A List is a functor:

          val myList:List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
          println(myList.map(_ * 4)) // PRINTS: List(4, 8, 12, 16)


Higher-Order Function - A function that can be passed a function as
                        a parameter, and/or can return a function.


Lambda - Another word for an anonymous function.
