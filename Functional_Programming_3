The following sample program passes a function (AKA, a block of code)
which returns an Int type to the function named timer().  Then, inside
the timer() function, the blockOfCode function passed to it gets executed.

  /**
    * @param blockOfCode -
    * @tparam A - The A type in the timer() function below is really the IntDoubleTuple
    *             type defined above.  If you replace all three A references in the timer()
    *             function below with references to IntDoubleTuple, the code still works.
    *
    * @return the type A in this example is the IntDoubleTuple type defined above.

    val startTime:Long = System.nanoTime
    // When the following line of code gets called, all code contained in the blockOfCode param
    // passed to this timer() function executes, including the Thread.sleep(1000) method.  The
    // value returned to codeBlock is the single Int value 42 returned by the blockOfCode parameter.

    // Even though codeBlock is of type A (the IntDoubleTuple type defined above),
    // codeBlock contains ONLY a single Int value, which is the Int value 42
    // returned by the blockOfCode parameter.  THAT'S WEIRD!...  Because if you
    // try to access codeBlock._1 or codeBlock._2, you'll get a compile error!

    val stopTime:Long  = System.nanoTime
