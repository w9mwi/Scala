In Scala, there are two kinds of program evaluations:

1) Eager Evaluation - Declared like this:
                      val counter:Int = 0
                      Code is evaluated at compile-time, or program deployment-time,
                      regardless if that code will be executed or not.
2) Lazy Evaluation - Declared like this:
                     lazy val counter:Int = 0
                     Code is evaluated on-demand, which means when only when the code
                     gets executed does it get evaluated.
