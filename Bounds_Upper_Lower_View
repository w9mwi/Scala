In Scala, Type Bounds are restrictions on Type Parameters or Type Variable.
By using Type Bounds, we can define the limits of a Type Variable.  Scala Type
Bounds ensure Type-Safe Application Development.

Scala supports the following Type Bounds for Type Variables:

1) Scala Upper Bounds - In Scala, we can define Upper Bound on Type Parameter as this:
                        [T <: S]
                        Which means Type Parameter T must be either same type as S or a sub-type of S.

2) Scala Lower Bounds
3) Scala View Bounds
