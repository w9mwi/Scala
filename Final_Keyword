Some times it is useful to declare a class member or method that cannot
be overridden/changed in a subtype.  This requirement can be enforced using
the "final" keyword.  Use the "final" keyword to modify member data or methods
that you do NOT want changed in subtypes.

The "final" keyword can also be used to modify an entire class.  A class
that's "final" means it cannot be a subtype of another class, which means
another class cannot inherit from it.
