 Instead of returning an object when a function succeeds,
 and null when it fails, your function should instead
 return an instance of the Option class, where the Option
 object is either a "Some" object, or a "None" object.
 
 NOTE: Both the "Some" class and the "None" class are
       children of the "Option" class.

Your function signature should declare that you're returning
an "Option" that will be some data type such as an Int, which
is shown in the example below.  Declaring that the function
returns an "Option" object lets the user of your function know
whatâ€™s going on.
