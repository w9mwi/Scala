A Scala "type class" is not a pre-defined Scala class like "class"
or "case class."  A Scala "type class" enables you to add new
behavior to existing classes (String, Int, List, etc.) without
modifying the existing class.

In many languages, to add a behaviour to a class would require you to
extend the class with an interface, and then implement methods against
this interface.  However, doing that doesn't scale, especially when
you have older libraries because you would have to make them depend
on a new interface, and have to re-build everything.
