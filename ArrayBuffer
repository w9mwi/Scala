NOTE: The Scala Vector class is the recommended “go to” class for
      IMMUTABLE, INDEXED SEQUENTIAL collections.

NOTE: The Scala ArrayBuffer class is the recommended “go to” class for
      MUTABLE, INDEXED SEQUENTIAL collections.  ArrayBuffer is an indexed,
      sequential collection.  Use ListBuffer if you prefer a linear,
      sequential collection that is MUTABLE.
