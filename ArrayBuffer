NOTE: The Scala Vector class is the recommended “go to” class for
      IMMUTABLE, INDEXED SEQUENTIAL collections.

NOTE: The Scala ArrayBuffer class is the recommended “go to” class for
      MUTABLE, INDEXED SEQUENTIAL collections.  ArrayBuffer is an indexed,
      sequential collection.  Use ListBuffer if you prefer a linear,
      sequential collection that is MUTABLE.

Regarding ArrayBuffer Performance
=================================
Append, update, and random access take constant time (amortized time).
Prepends and removes are linear in the buffer size.  The ArrayBuffer
documentation states: ArrayBuffers are useful for efficiently building
up a large collection whenever the new items are always added to the end.

If you need a mutable sequential collection that works more like
a List (i.e., a linear sequence rather than an indexed sequence)
use ListBuffer instead of ArrayBuffer.  A ListBuffer is like an
ArrayBuffer, except that it uses a linked list internally instead
of an Array.  If you plan to convert the buffer to a List once it's
built, use a ListBuffer instead of an ArrayBuffer.
