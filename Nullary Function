Assume we have a function that takes an argument that is a function.  That function
argument (which is also a function) has a name, which gets passed some type, and it
returns some type.  For example, the following function takes an argument (that is
also a function) having the name processNumber, which takes an Int argument, and
returns an Int.

def myFunc(processNumber:(Int => Int)):Int = { Some code that returns an Int. }

In Scala, you can pass a function an argument that is a function, has a name, and
returns some type, but what it takes as an argument HAS NO TYPE.  This is called
a Nullary Function.

The reason a Nullary Function's argument has no type is because it gets passed an expression
(i.e., executable code) instead of data that has a type.  The following code sample shows
a recursive curried function which gets passed two Nullary Functions.  Read the in-line
comments below to understand its behavior.

object Demo
{
  def main(args: Array[String])
  {
    var count = 5

    // The following forloop function returns Unit.  When the forloop function is called here,
    // IT IS CALLED WITH 2 ARGUMENT LISTS!  The second argument list contains the print AND
    // the count -= 1 lines of code!!!  Whenever an argument contains multiple lines of
    // executable code (versus an Int value, for example), the argument MUST be enclosed
    // within curly braces {}, instead of within parenthesis ().
    forloop(count > 0)
    {
      print("count = " + count + ",  ") // PRINTS: count = 5,  count = 4,  count = 3,  count = 2,  count = 1,
      count -= 1
    }
    println("\nThe End.")
  }

  /**
    * NOTICE: This forloop function is recursive, has a multiple argument list, and BOTH
    *         arguments are functions that are passed nothing.  Since these function
    *         arguments (named "rule" and "body") get passed nothing (one returns a Boolean,
    *         the other returns Unit), they are known as nullary functions.
    */
  def forloop(rule: => Boolean)(body: => Unit):Unit =
  {
    if (rule)
    {
      // The following line of code calls the function named body.  When body is called, the
      // two lines of code contained in the forloop (located in the above main() method)
      // get called.  If body is not called here, the count will never get printed, the Int
      // value count will never get decremented, and forloop will run in an infinite loop!!!
      body
      forloop(rule)(body) // This is a RECURSIVE function call, which executes until "rule" becomes false.
    }
  }
