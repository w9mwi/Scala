A regular Scala object is created using the “object” keyword.
By default, it’s a singleton object.

A Scala Case Object is created using the “case object” keywords.
By default, it’s also a singleton object.

By Default, a Case Object contains the toString() and hashCode() methods,
while a regular object does not contain those methods.

By Default, a Case Object IS Serializable, but a regular object is NOT.
The following code shows that a regular Scala object is NOT Serializable,
and a case object IS Serializable.

object RegularObject
case object CaseObject

RegularObject.isInstanceOf[Serializable] // Returns false.
CaseObject.isInstanceOf[Serializable]    // Returns true.
