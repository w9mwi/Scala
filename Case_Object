A regular Scala object is created using the “object” keyword.
By default, it’s a singleton object.

A Scala "case object" is declared by using the “case object”
keywords.  The following list reveals the differences between
a Scala "case class" and a "case object"...

1) A "case object" is a singleton object, which means there can be
   ONLY ONE INSTANCE of it.  You CAN'T create multiple instances
   of a "case object" as you can with a "case class".
2) A "case object" CAN'T contain an argument list, but it
   CAN contain member values and member methods/functions.
3) A "case class" MUST contain an argument list, and therefore
   must contain member values.

By Default, a "case object" contains the toString() and hashCode() methods,
while a regular object does not contain those methods.

By default, a "case object" IS Serializable, but a regular object is NOT.
The following code shows that a regular Scala object is NOT Serializable,
and a "case object" IS Serializable.

object RegularObject
case object CaseObject
RegularObject.isInstanceOf[Serializable] // Returns false.
CaseObject.isInstanceOf[Serializable]    // Returns true.

A case object CAN extend a trait, as the following example shows.
trait Event
case object SimpleEvent extends Event
