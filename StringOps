StringOps is an immutable subtype of IndexedSeq.  StringOps provides Scala collection
operations on strings, as many of the methods that we use on strings sre not defined
in the java.lang.String type.  Instead, there is an implicit conversion from
java.lang.String to scala.collection.immutable.StringOps.  That is how the following
line of code works, as java.lang.String doesn't have a filter() or partition() method.

val (upper, lower) = "Tis is a string.".filter(_.isLetter).partition(_.isUpper)

When Scala interprets the above line of code, it sees the filter() and partition()
methods don't exist in java.lang.String, so it then looks for an implicit
conversion that will give a type that has the needed methods.  In this case the
conversion will be to StringOps.
