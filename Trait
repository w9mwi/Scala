There are three ways to create a data type in Scala:

1) object
2) class
3) trait

NOTE: In the Scala API documentation...
      1) A circled 'c' represents a class.
      2) A circled 'o' represents an object.
      3) A circled 'p' represents a package.
      4) A circled 't' represents a trait.

A Scala class, case class, object or trait can extend ONLY ONE
class/object, but they can all extend any number of traits.
A trait can extend ONLY ONE class/object.

If you want to implement multiple inheritance in a class/trait,
that class/trait must extend TWO (2) or more Scala traits.

Traits look nearly the same as a class.  However, just like objects,
traits CAN'T take parameters.  This is the syntax for defining a trait:

trait <identifier> [extends <identifier>] [{ fields, methods, and classes }]

Below are four (4) declarations that show how to extend traits.

// A CLASS that extends one class and multiple traits...
class Class_1 extends Class_2 with Trait_A with Trait_B { ... }

// A CLASS that extends no class and multiple traits...
class Class_1 extends Trait_A with Trait_B with Trait_C { ... }

// A TRAIT that extends one class and multiple traits...
trait Trait_A extends Class_A with Trait_B with Trait_C { ... }

// A TRAIT that extends no class and multiple traits...
trait Trait_E extends trait_D with trait_C with trait_B with trait_A { ... }

QUESTION: When coding an abstract type that WILL BE USED WITH INHERITANCE,
          should a "trait" or an "abstract class" be used?

ANSWER: The rule of thumb is to use a trait because traits are capable of
        always functioning properly when multiple inheritance is implemented.
        While a trait can't take arguments (as can an abstract class can),
        any vals/vars that you'd generally provide as arguments can be put
        into a trait and left undefined, so the class that implements
        the trait will have to provide those values.

Some important differences between a Scala class/object and a trait are:

1) Traits allow multiple inheritance to always function properly because Scala's
   trait linearization algorithm always resolves the ambiguity of which method
   should get called when multiple inheritance encounters the "diamond problem."
   Trait lineraization and the "diamond problem" is explained further below.

2) A class/object can extend any number of traits.
   A trait can extend ONLY ONE class/object, and any number of traits.

3) A trait CAN'T contain arguments/parameters like a class can.
   For example, you can define a class like below, which contains
   the arguments/parameters x and y...
   class Point(x: Int, y: Int) // Will compile

   The following attempt to define a trait WON'T compile
   because it contains arguments/parameters...
   trait Point(x: Int, y: Int) // Won't compile

4) A call to super.methodName() IN A CLASS is STATICALLY BOUND if the
   super.methodName() is contained in a PARENT CLASS (not in a parent
   trait).  This means the PARENT CLASS METHOD that gets called is
   DETERMINED AT COMPILE-TIME.

   If a class/trait inherits a method that EXISTS IN TWO (2) OR MORE PARENT
   TRAITS, a call to super.methodName() is DYNAMICALLY BOUND.  This means
   the PARENT TRAIT METHOD that gets called is DETERMINED AT RUNTIME via
   the Scala trait linearization algorithm.

5) A class/object CAN be instantiated.
   A trait CAN'T be instantiated.
   
   NOTE: A trait is always abstract by definition, which means a trait CAN'T be
         instantiated.  The code below defines Person as a trait.  The main()
         function then APPEARS to instantiate a trait by calling:  new Person...

         The code compiles and successfully executes, but it DOESN'T instatiate
         the Person trait!!!  Instead, the code is instantiating an ANONYMOUS CLASS
         using the Person trait.  An anonynous class is NOT abstract so an anonymous
         class CAN be instantiated.  So a trait can be used to instantiate an
         anonymous class.  But you CAN'T instantiate a trait.  Read in-line comments
         in the code sample for details.

         For more info on anonymous classes see:
         https://github.com/w9mwi/Scala/blob/master/Class_Anonymous
==================================================================================
 object Demo
 {
   trait Person {
     def name:String
     def age:Int
     override def toString = s"name = $name,  age = $age"
   }

   def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
     val tom:Person = new Person { val name:String = "tom"
                                   val age:Int = 17 }
     println(tom) // PRINTS: name = tom,  age = 17

     // Even though Person is defined above as a trait, the following
     // println reveals that Person tom is an anonymous class because
     // the text 'anon' is contained in the class name.  So the above
     // "new Person..." instantiates an anonymous class, NOT a trait.
     println(tom.getClass.toString) // PRINTS: class Demo$$anon$1
   }
 }

==================================================================================
If a trait/class contains a member function that     IS defined, that member method is concrete.
If a trait/class contains a member function that  ISN'T defined, that member method is abstract.
If a trait/class contains a member value that    IS initialized, that member value is concrete.
If a trait/class contains a member value that ISN'T initialized, that member value is abstract.

A trait is very similar to an abstract class in many ways.  When a class extends a
trait that has an abstract method (a method that's declared, but not defined), each
abstract method contained in the trait must be defined in the class that extends
the trait.  The following sample code shows how to use a Scala trait, and shows how
both abstract and concrete trait methods are implemented.

object Demo
{
  trait Pet
  {
    // comeToMaster is an ABSTRACT method because it's just declared, but not defined.
    // speak is a CONCRETE method because it's defined.
    def comeToMaster:Unit
    def speak:Unit = { println("I speak the universal Pet language.") }
    
  }

  class Dog extends Pet
  {
    def comeToMaster:Unit = { println("I'm a Dog, so I come when called.") }
  }

  class Cat extends Pet
  {
    override def speak:Unit = { println("MEOW") } // The override key word is required here.
    def comeToMaster:Unit   = { println("I'm a Cat, so I don't follow orders.") }
  }

  def main(args: Array[String])
  {
    val catPet:Cat = new Cat()
    catPet.speak        // PRINTS: MEOW
    catPet.comeToMaster // PRINTS: I'm a Cat, so I don't follow orders.

    val dogPet:Dog = new Dog()
    dogPet.speak        // PRINTS: I speak the universal Pet language.
    dogPet.comeToMaster // PRINTS: I'm a Dog, so I come when called.
  }
}

==================================================================================

When a class extends another class/trait, the in-line code contained in each
class/trait gets executed upon instantiation of the base class.  The sample
code shown below reveals the execution order of this in-line code.

class Class_B extends Class_A with Trait_A with Trait_B
val classB:Class_B = new Class_B

When that code executes, the in-line code contained
in each class/trait is executed in this order:

1) Class_A in-line code executes.
2) Trait_A in-line code executes.
3) Trait_B in-line code executes.
4) Class_B in-line code executes.
5) NOTICE: Both Trait_A and Trait_B extend Class_A, but Trait_A and Trait_B
           DON'T invoke Class_A in-line code.  Class_A in-line code executes
           only once.  It's important to understand this behavior.  To sum up...

FIRST: In-line code in all EXTENDED class/traits is executed upon class instantiation,
       BEFORE in-line code is executed in the base class.
NEXT:  In-line code in the instantiated class (Class_B) is executed LAST.
ALSO:  Any class/trait is capable of EXTENDING another class/trait, which
       can affect class/trait method behavior, but WON'T affect the
       behavior of class/trait in-line code.

Notice that Trait_A and Trait_B both extend Class_A in the following code
sample, and both those traits contain a test() method that overrides the
Class_A.test() method.  The last line of code in main() is this line:

classB.test()

That line of code calls the Trait_B.test() method because Scala
implements the following rules when searching for a method in an
extended class/trait.  The method search follows this order...

1) First, in the instantiated class.
2) Second, in the class's extended class (if one exists),
   from the highest-to-lowest superclass.
3) Third, in an extended trait (if one exists).  Trait methods
   are found by searching for them in RIGHT-TO-LEFT order of
   how traits appear in the declaration, and then from the
   highest-to-lowest superclass.


object Demo

  class Class_A
  {
    println("Class_A in-line code executes.")

  }

    override def test():Unit = println("Trait_B.test() called.")
  }

    println("Class_B in-line code executes.")
  }

  def main(args: Array[String])

                                     // Trait_A in-line code executes.

TRAIT LINEARIZATION (TRAIT METHOD RESOLUTION)
=============================================
Trait linearization is the algorithm used by Scala to determine which trait
method should get called when the multiple inheritance "diamond problem" is
encountered.

                         Class_A
                            |
                     ---------------
                     |             |
                  Trait_A       Trait_B
                     |             |
                     ---------------
                            |
                         Class_B

The above inheritance diagram represents the inheritance "diamond problem."
Assume ONLY Class_A contains a method named test(), which 
For the code to compile, the method definition for test() in both Trait_A
and Trait_B MUST contain the 'override' keyword to designate those
methods override the test() method inherited from Class_A.

If Class_B calls the test() method, which

can be properly resolved ONLY by using
Scala traits, as is demonstrated in the executable sample code below.

The above inheritance diagram represents the following Scala declarations:

class Class_A                  {          def test():String= "Class_A.test() called." }
trait Trait_A extends Class_A  { override def test():String= "Trait_A.test() called." }
trait Trait_B extends Class_A  { override def test():String= "Trait_B.test() called." }
class Class_B extends Trait_A with Trait_B {  } // Empty class.

When the main() program

Notice that Class_B above DOESN'T define the test() method.  The 'override' keyword
is REQUIRED in the Trait_A.test() and Trait_B.test() definitions so they'll override
the inherited Class_A.test() method.

You might expesct 



QUESTION:
Since Class_B inherits from both Trait_A and Trait_B, will classB.test() invoke the
Trait_A.test() method or the Trait_A.test() method?

ANSWER:
The Trait_B.test() method will be invoked.


========================================================================================
object Demo
{
  class Class_A
  {
    println("Class_A in-line code executes.")
    def test(color:String):Unit = println(s"Class_A.test() called.  color = $color")
  }
  trait Trait_A extends Class_A
  {
    println("Trait_A in-line code executes.")
    override def test(color:String):Unit = super.test("GREEN")
  }
  trait Trait_B extends Class_A
  {
    println("Trait_B in-line code executes.")
    override def test(color:String):Unit = super.test("BLUE")
  }

  def main(args: Array[String])
  {
    val classA:Class_A = new Class_A with Trait_A
    classA.test("POOP")
  }
}
========================================================================================

The multiple inheritance "diamond problem" is an ambiguity that arises when...

1) Class_A, Trait_A, and Trait_B all contain a method with an identical name and signature.
   In this example.
the two traits (Trait_B and Trait_C) inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C?




Trait linearization applies to a class or trait that inherits from multiple traits,
AND calls a parent trait method via super.methodName().  Also, the parent trait
method called via super.methodName() must exist in TWO OR MORE of the inherited traits.

In other words, TWO OR MORE of the inherited traits must contain a method
with identical signatures.  (NOTE: A method's signature is defined as the
method's name + argument list + return type.)

When one of these inherited trait methods (having identical signatures) is
called FROM THE CHILD class/trait via super.methodName(), Scala uses the trait
linearization algorithm to determine which one of those trait methods
(having identical signatures) gets called.

EXAMPLE:  Assume trait_A and trait_B both contain this method:

          def increment(number:Int) = { number + 1 }

          Now, we declare a child class (or child trait) that
          inherits from both trait_A and trait_B, like this:

          class class_A extends trait_A with trait_B { ... }

          QUESTION:
          When class_A calls super.increment() will the trait_A.increment()
          method or trait_B.increment() method get called?

          ANSWER:
          Scala will implement trait linearization to determine whether
          trait_A.increment() or trait_B.increment() gets called.
          The algorithm Scala uses to perform trait linearization
          is described further below along with some sample code.


To better understand Scala linearization, let's repeat these
two rules mentioned further above.

1) A call to super.methodName() IN A CLASS is STATICALLY BOUND if the super.methodName()
   is contained in a PARENT CLASS (not in a parent trait).  This means the
   PARENT CLASS METHOD that gets called is DETERMINED AT COMPILE-TIME.

2) If a class/trait inherits a method that EXISTS IN TWO (2) OR MORE PARENT
   TRAITS, a call to super.methodName() is DYNAMICALLY BOUND.  This means the
   PARENT TRAIT METHOD that gets called is DETERMINED AT RUNTIME via the
   Scala trait linearization algorithm.
   
VERY IMPORTANT: Trait linearization applies only to trait methods
                (not class methods) called via super.methodName()
                from a child class, or a child trait.

The following code shows an example of this, where each of the 3 traits
extends the same class (named Ball).  And all 3 traits override the
Ball.roll() method.
=====================================================================================
object Demo
{
  class Ball {
    def roll(ball : String): Unit = println("Rolling: " + ball)
  }

  trait Red extends Ball {
    override def roll(ball: String): Unit = super.roll("Red-" + ball)
  }

  trait Green extends Ball {
    override def roll(ball: String): Unit = super.roll("Green-" + ball)
  }

  trait Shiny extends Ball {
    override def roll(ball: String): Unit = super.roll("Shiny-" + ball)
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]):Unit = {
    val ball1 = new Ball() with Shiny with Red
    ball1.roll("Ball-1") // Rolling: Shiny-Red-Ball-1

    val ball2 = new Ball with Green with Shiny
    ball2.roll("Ball-2") // Rolling: Green-Shiny-Ball-2

    val ball3 = new Ball with Red with Shiny
    ball3.roll("Ball-3") // Rolling: Red-Shiny-Ball-3

    val ball4 = new Ball with Shiny with Green
    ball4.roll("Ball-4") // Rolling: Shiny-Green-Ball-4
  }
}
=====================================================================================

object Demo
{
  class Vehicle
  {
    def method:String= "Vehicle "
  }

  trait Bike extends Vehicle
  {
    override def method:String = "Bike -> "+ super.method
  }

  trait MuscleBike extends Vehicle
  {
    override def method:String = "Muscle Bike -> "+ super.method
  }

The following sample code does NOT deal with trait Linearization.
Just read the code and comments to understand it.

object Demo
{
  trait Equal {
    def isEqual(x: Any): Boolean
    def isNotEqual(x: Any): Boolean = !isEqual(x)
  }

  class Point(xc: Int, yc: Int) extends Equal {
    val x: Int = xc // This line executes ONLY when a Point class is instantiated.
    val y: Int = yc // This line executes ONLY when a Point class is instantiated.

    def isEqual(obj: Any):Boolean =
    {
      if (obj.isInstanceOf[Point] && obj.asInstanceOf[Point].x == xc && obj.asInstanceOf[Point].y == yc)

    println(p1.isEqual(p2)) // PRINTS: false
    println("--------------------------")
    println(p1.isEqual(p3)) // PRINTS: false
    println("--------------------------")
    println(p1.isEqual(p4)) // PRINTS: xc = 1,  yc = 2
                            //         obj.asInstanceOf[Point].x = 1,  obj.asInstanceOf[Point].y = 2
                            //         true
    println("--------------------------")
    println(p1.isNotEqual(p4)) // PRINTS: xc = 1,  yc = 2
                               //         obj.asInstanceOf[Point].x = 1,  obj.asInstanceOf[Point].y = 2
                               //         false
    println("--------------------------")
    println(p1.isNotEqual(1)) // PRINTS: true
  }
}

===================================================================



When implementing multiple inheritance, a function having the same name
and signature (args + return type) CAN'T exist in more than one class
or trait from which you inherit--unless the function inherits from
another class/trait having the same function name + signature,
and is defined using the "override" keyword.

Below is an example where the traits DON'T use inheritance.  The following
code will NOT compile because func_A() exists in BOTH trait_A and in trait_D.
To make the below code compile, COMMENT OUT ONE of those two func_A() definitions.
===================================================================
object Demo
{
  trait trait_A
  {
    println("trait_A constructed.")
    def func_A() = { println("trait_A.func_A() is called.") }
  }
  trait trait_B
  {
    println("trait_B constructed.")
    def func_B() = { println("trait_B.func_B() is called.") }
  }
  trait trait_C
  {
    println("trait_C constructed.")
    def func_C() = { println("trait_C.func_C() is called.") }
  }
  trait trait_D
  {
    println("trait_D constructed.")
    // def func_A() = { println("trait_D.func_A() is called.") }
    def func_D() = { println("trait_D.func_D() is called.") }
  }
  class class_1
  {
    println("class_1 constructed.")
  }
  class class_2 extends class_1 with trait_D  with trait_C  with trait_B  with trait_A
  {
    println("class_2 constructed.")
  }

  /**********************
   * main() function.
   *********************/
  def main(args: Array[String]):Unit =
  {
    val class_2:class_2 = new class_2()
    class_2.func_A()
  }
}
===================================================================




Run the sample program shown further below and notice the following.

When this line is executed:  var classA:class_A = new class_A with trait_D with trait_C with trait_B
This text is printed:  class_A construted.
                       trait_D construted.
                       trait_C construted.
                       trait_B construted.

When this line is executed:  classA = new class_A with trait_D2 with trait_C2 with trait_B2
This text is printed:  class_A construted.
                       trait_D2 construted.
                       trait_B2 construted.
                       trait_C2 construted.

The printed text that results from executing those two lines of code
reveals the order in which the classes and traits are constructed.
The order in which the classes/traits are constructed is ALWAYS IDENTICAL
to the order they appear in the declaration, from left to right.

The order in which linearization occurs (to determine which method(s) get called)
is THE REVERSE ORDER that the classes/traits and are constructed, which is
the right-to-left order of the classes/traits as they appear in the declaration.

Because Scala's linearization algorithm is too complicated to easily explain
verbally, its instead explained by the following 5-step process.

====================================================================

In the sample code below, these 2 lines exist in the main() method:
var classA:class_A = new class_A with trait_D with trait_C with trait_B
println(classA.func())

Following the 5 steps below will show us how to determine what
text gets printed by println(classA.func())

1) LOOKING AT THE SAMPLE CODE BELOW, draw a hierarchy diagram of the
   classes and traits referenced in this declaration:
   var classA:class_A = new class_A with trait_D with trait_C with trait_B

       class_A
         |
     -------------------
     |        |        |
  trait_B  trait_C  trait_D

2) Specify the linearization path for each class/trait in the diagram,
   where the letter L designates Linearization.

   L(class_A) = class_A
   L(trait_B) = trait_B -> class_A
   L(trait_C) = trait_C -> class_A
   L(trait_D) = trait_D -> class_A

3) Following the RIGHT-TO-LEFT order of the following declaration,
   specify the order in which Scala will perform linearization.
   var classA:class_A = new class_A with trait_D with trait_C with trait_B

   L(trait_B) -> L(trait_C) -> L(trait_D) -> L(class_A)

4) Rewrite the linearization sequence obtained in step 3) by substituting
   what we obtained in step 2) for L(class_A), L(trait_B), etc.

   (trait_B -> class_A) -> (trait_C -> class_A) -> (trait_D -> class_A) -> (class_A)

5) Copy the linearization sequence obtained in step 4) from RIGHT TO LEFT
   but DON'T COPY DUPLICATES.  For example, class_A is the first element we
   copy (from right to left), so all other references to class_A are NOT copied.

   FINAL LINEARIZATION RESULT:
   class_A -> trait_D -> trait_C -> trait_B

   From this result we can determine that println(classA.func())
   prints this line of text:   trait_B

====================================================================

In the sample code below, these 2 lines exist in the main() method:
classA = new class_A with trait_D2 with trait_C2 with trait_B2
println(classA.func())

Following the 5 steps below will show us how to determine what
text gets printed by println(classA.func())

1) LOOKING AT THE SAMPLE CODE BELOW, draw a hierarchy diagram of the
   classes and traits referenced in this declaration:
   classA = new class_A with trait_D2 with trait_C2 with trait_B2

       class_A
         |
     ---------
     |       |
  trait_B2  trait_D2
     |
  trait_C2

2) Specify the linearization path for each class/trait in the diagram,
   where the letter L designates Linearization.

   L(class_A) = class_A
   L(trait_B2) = trait_B2 -> class_A
   L(trait_C2) = trait_C2 -> trait_B2 -> class_A
   L(trait_D2) = trait_D2 -> class_A

3) Following the RIGHT-TO-LEFT order of the following declaration,
   specify the order in which Scala will perform linearization.
   classA = new class_A with trait_D2 with trait_C2 with trait_B2

   L(trait_B2) -> L(trait_C2) -> L(trait_D2) -> L(class_A)

4) Rewrite the linearization sequence obtained in step 3) by substituting
   what we obtained in step 2) for L(trait_A), L(trait_B2), etc.

   (trait_B2 -> class_A) -> (trait_C2 -> trait_B2 -> class_A) -> (trait_D2 -> class_A) -> (class_A)

5) Copy the linearization sequence obtained in step 4) from RIGHT TO LEFT
   but DON'T COPY DUPLICATES.  For example, class_A is the first element we
   copy (from right to left), so all other references to class_A are NOT copied.

   FINAL LINEARIZATION RESULT:
   trait_C2 -> trait_B2 -> trait_D2 -> class_A

   From this result we can determine that println(classA.func())
   prints this line of text:  trait_C2 trait_B2 trait_D2 class_A

===================================================================


It's possible for a function having the same name and signature
to be defined in multiple Scala classes and traits.  Assume a
Scala base class named Class_1 has this definition:

class Class_1 extends Class_2 with Trait_A with Trait_B with Trait_C

Also assume a function named func_A() is defined in many of those classes
and traits, and all those func_A definitions have identical signatures
(args and return type).  When Class_1.func_A() gets called, this is the
order Scala searches to determine which func_A() gets invoked:

1) Class_1 (the base class) is searched for func_A().
2) The highest-to-lowest superclass of Class_2 is searched for func_A().
3) Class_2 (the extended class) is searched for func_A().
4) The highest-to-lowest superclass of Trait_C is searched for func_A().
5) The highest-to-lowest superclass of Trait_B is searched for func_A().
6) The highest-to-lowest superclass of Trait_A is searched for func_A().
7) Trait_C is searched for func_A().
8) Trait_B is searched for func_A().
9) Trait_A is searched for func_A().

THE FIRST INSTANCE OF func_A() FOUND IS THE FUNCTION THAT GETS INVOKED.
This process of resolving which function gets invoked is called LINEARIZATION.

Below is sample code showing which function gets invoked via Scala's LINEARIZATION process.

Here's another sample program showing how to use Scala traits...

  {
    def draw() { }
  }

  trait Cowboy extends Drawable
  {
    override def draw() = { println("BANG!  The Cowboy drew a gun.") }
  }

  trait Artist extends Drawable
  {
    override def draw() = { println("PICTURE!  The Artist drew a painting.") }
  }

  class ArtistCowboy extends Artist with Cowboy
  class CowboyArtist extends Cowboy with Artist

  def main(args: Array[String])
  {
    val artCow = new ArtistCowboy()
    val cowArt = new CowboyArtist()

    // For artCow, Scala searches for the draw() function first in the Cowboy trait, then
    // in the Artist trait.  The Cowboy.draw() function is found first, so it gets called.
    artCow.draw() // PRINTS:  BANG!  The Cowboy drew a gun.

    // For cowArt, Scala searches for the draw() function first in the Artist trait, then
    // in the Cowboy trait.  The Artist.draw() function is found first, so it gets called.
    cowArt.draw() // PRINTS:  PICTURE!  The Artist drew a painting.
  }
}

=======================================================================================

Rich Interface - A rich interface has many methods, which makes it convenient to use
                 because the caller is likely to find a method that exactly matches the
                 functionality she needs.

Thin Interface - A thin interface has fewer methods than a rich interface, so it's easier
                 for the programmer to write a thin interface than a rich interface.
                 However, the programmer who uses a thin interface will likely require
                 her to write more code because the thin interface supplies fewer methods
                 than the rich interface.

Traits can be used to enrich a thin interface, transforming it into a rich interface,
as is shown in the following example...

Look at the Point, Rectangle, and Component classes defined here.  Continue reading below.

class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int)
class Rectangle(val topLeft: Point, val bottomRight: Point)
{
  def left = topLeft.x
  def right = bottomRight.x
  def width = right - left
  // Assume more methods belong to this Rectangle class.
}
abstract class Component
{
  def topLeft: Point
  def bottomRight: Point

  def left = topLeft.x
  def right = bottomRight.x
  def width = right - left
  // Assume more methods belong to this abstract class Component.
}

Notice the left, right, and width methods defined above in the Rectangle class
are identical to the ones defined above in the abstract class Component.
These 3 methods will also likely reside in any other classes representing
rectangular objects.

This repetition can be eliminated with an enrichment trait shown immediately
below that's named Rectangular.  This Rectangular trait has two abstract
methods: one that returns the top-left coordinate of the object, and another
that returns the bottom-right coordinate.  It can then supply concrete
implementations of all the other geometric queries.

trait Rectangular
{
  def topLeft: Point
  def bottomRight: Point

  def left = topLeft.x
  def right = bottomRight.x
  def width = right - left
  // Assume more methods belong to this trait named Rectangular.
}

We can now redefine the above class Rectangle, and abstract class Component,
as follows.  This time, both classes are defined by extending the Rectangular
trait.  In other words, both these classes "mix-in" the Rectangular trait...

abstract class Component extends Rectangular
{
  // Assume more methods belong to this abstract class Component.
}
class Rectangle(val topLeft: Point, val bottomRight: Point) extends Rectangular
{
  // Assume more methods belong to this Rectangle class.
}
