There are two main differences between a Set type and a Seq type.  They are:

1) A Set does NOT allow duplicate values.  If you try adding a value to a
   Set that already exists in the Set, the Set contents remain unchanged.
2) The order of elements in a Set is NOT guaranteed.

There are mutable Sets and immutable Sets.  If you don't use an import
statement to declare the type of Set you're using, the Set will be
immutable by default...

scala.collection.immutable.Set - The default Set used when an import statement for Set isn't declared.
import scala.collection.mutable.Set - To use a mutable Set, you must include this import statement.
