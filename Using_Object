scala.util.Using is a Scala defined object, NOT a class.

scala.util.Using is a utility for performing automatic resource management.
It can be used to perform an operation using resources, after which it
releases the resources in reverse order of their creation.

Notice that whenever the Scala object Using is invoked it takes
two parameter lists, like this...

Using(param1){ An ANONYMOUS FUNCTION }
...which may look something like this...
Using(inputSourceName){ x => Code that processes x; where x is the Buffer or Seq contents of the inputSource. }

Below is a sample program that implements scala.util.Using to read lines
of text from a file, and then print that text to the screen.
Read in-line comments for details.

=================================================================

import java.io.{BufferedReader, FileReader, PrintWriter}
import scala.io.Source
import scala.util.{Failure, Success, Try, Using}

object Demo
{
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
  {
    val lines: Try[Seq[String]] =
      Using(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/home/tjb/file.txt")))
      {
        reader => Iterator.continually(reader.readLine()).takeWhile(_ != null).toSeq
      }

    lines match {
      case Failure(x) => { println("Try / Failure") }
      case Success(x:Seq[String]) => {
        println(x) // Shows a List, each element storing one line of the text file.
        println("Try / Success\nRead file and output its text to screen.");

        // The below call to x.mkString("\n") concats all strings in x (a Seq[String])
        // into a single string.  Where a newline Char ("\n") is first appended to the
        // end of each String contained in each Seq element.
        println(x.mkString("\n")) //  PRINTS contents of the text file.
      }
    }

    // Here's a shorter, alternative way of reading and printing the text file...
    Using(Source.fromFile("/home/tjb/file.txt"))
    {
      source => for (line <- source.getLines()){println(line)} // {} can be replaced with ()
    }

    //
    Using.Manager { use =>
      val in  = use(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/home/tjb/file.txt")))
      val out = use(new PrintWriter("/home/tjb/output.txt"))
    }
  }
}
