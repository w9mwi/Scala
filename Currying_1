Using functions that have multiple parameter groups makes it
easier to create partially-applied functions.

A function that takes multiple arguments (whether or not
those arguments are contained in one or multiple parameter
groups) can be translated into a series of function calls
that each take a single argument.  Assume the following:

f(x) = x + 1
f(y) = f(x) * y
f(z) = (f(y)) ^ 2

If x = 3, and y = 2, and z = 3, the following is true...

f(x) = 3 + 1 = 4
f(y) = 4 * 2 = 8
f(z) = 8 ^ 3 = 512
