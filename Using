scala.util.Using is a Scala defined object, NOT a class.

scala.util.Using is a utility for performing automatic resource management.
It can be used to perform an operation using resources, after which it
releases the resources in reverse order of their creation.

Below is a sample program that implements scala.util.Using to read lines
of text from a file, and then print that text to the screen.
Read in-line comments for details.

import java.io.{BufferedReader, FileReader}
import scala.io.Source
import scala.util.{Failure, Success, Try, Using}

object Demo
{
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
  {
    val lines: Try[Seq[String]] =
      Using(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/home/tjb/file.txt")))
      {
        reader => Iterator.continually(reader.readLine()).takeWhile(_ != null).toSeq
      }

    lines match {
      case Failure(x) => { println("Try / Failure") }
      case Success(x:Seq[String]) => {
           println(x) // Shows a List, each element storing one line of the text file.
           println("Try / Success\nRead file and output its text to screen.");

           // The below call to x.mkString("\n") concats all strings in x (a Seq[String])
           // into a single string.  Where a newline Char ("\n") is first appended to the
           // end of each String contained in each Seq element.
           println(x.mkString("\n")) //  PRINTS contents of the text file.
      }
    }

    // Here's a shorter, alternative way of reading and printing the text file...
    Using(Source.fromFile("/home/tjb/file.txt"))
    {
      source => for (line <- source.getLines()){println(line)} // {} can be replaced with ()
    }
  }
}
